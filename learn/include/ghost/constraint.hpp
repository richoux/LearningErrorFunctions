/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ library 
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem 
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of 
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP/CFN. 
 *
 * GHOST has been first developped to help making AI for the RTS game
 * StarCraft: Brood war, but can be used for any kind of applications where 
 * solving combinatorial and optimization problems within some tenth of 
 * milliseconds is needed. It is a generalization of the Wall-in project.

		//! Pure virtual method to compute the error of the constraint with the current assignment in Constraint::_ptr_variables.
		/*!
		 * This method is fundamental: it evalutes how much the current values of variables violate this contraint.
		 * Let's consider the following example : consider the contraint (x = y).\n
		 * If x = 42 and y = 42, then these values satify the contraint. The error is then 0.\n
		 * If x = 42 and y = 40, the constraint is not satified, but intuitively, we are closer to have a solution than with
		 * x = 42 and y = 10,000. Thus the error when y = 40 must be strictly lower than the error when y = 10,000.\n
		 * Thus, a required_error candidate for the contraint (x = y) could be the function |x-y|.
		 * 
		 * This method MUST returns a value greater than or equals to 0.
		 *
		 * We have the choice: if your are modeling a CSP or COP problem, then required_error should outputs 0 if
		 * current values of variables satisfy your constraint, and something strictly higher than 0, like 1 
		 * for instance, otherwise.
		 * If you are modeling an EFSP/EFOP problem, then it still must outputs 0 for satisfying values of variables, 
		 * but must outputs a value strictly higher than 0 otherwise, such that the higher this value, the further
		 * current values of variables are from satisfying your constraint.
		 *
		 * \warning DO NOT implement any side effect in this method. It is called by the solver 
		 * to compute the constraint error but also for some inner mechanisms (such as error simulations).
		 *
		 * \param variables A const reference of the vector of variables in the scope of the constraint. The solver is calling this method with
		 * Constraint::_ptr_variables as input. This is mostly to have the same interface than Objective::required_cost.
		 * \return A positive double corresponding to the error of the constraint.
		 * Outputing 0 means that given variable values satisfy the constraint.

		 * The current assignment, as well as its error, are automatically stored in the class Constraint.
		 * Giving a vector of variable indexes and their respective candidate value, this methods ouputs the difference between the 
		 * error of the current assignment in Constraint::_ptr_variables and the error we would get if we assign new candidate values to variables given as input.
		 *
		 * The ouput can be negative, positive, or equals to 0. If the candidate error is strictly lower (then better) than the current error, 
		 * the ouput is negative. If errors are the same, the ouputs equals to 0. Finally, if the candidate error is strictly higher (then worth) 
		 * than the current error, the ouput is positive.
		 * 
		 * For instance, let's assume the constraint is #find a better example#
		 * 
		 * If your problem is modeled as an EFSP/EFOP, then this method is VERY important to have faster computation. Although optional (the solver still works without it),
		 * we strongly advise you to define it properly, unless your required_error method is trivial to compute. Having this method may make a big difference for the solver 
		 * to quickly find better solutions.
		 * However, if your problem is modeled as an CSP/COP, you can just skip implementing this method.
